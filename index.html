<h2>Welcome to Matanakunai Ward Information Site</h2>
</center>
<p>
Matanakunai Ward aims to establish an environment that is conducive and safe for a 
better livelihood and promote partnership, transparency, accountability, and individual 
ownership of its land and resources.  It will ensure that basic necessities are set as first 
priorities in order to meet individual needs and wants and to encourage more sustainable 
developments into the concern areas and the community as a whole.<p>
 
In our mere effort to achieve our vision, Matanakunai Ward, through the Ward 
Development Committees and with the support of the community and other stake-holders, 
seek to improve its performance through;<p>
<h3>1. Economic Development.</h3>
Due to a lot of problems faced in terms of service delivery, the ward is looking 
forward to engage companies and other business houses that intend to use the 
land for economic activities. Benefits obtained from these projects will be equally 
distributed among individual land owners through community projects or 
individual benefits within their own ILGs.<p>
<h3>2. Basic Government Services.</h3>
It will also seek further basic services from the government to support the needs 
of its people. In doing so, the ward is envisaged to present the peopleâ€™s issues to 
the LLG Chamber for further deliberation.<p>
