<p>We are being linked to Open Bay by a logging road and recently being mandated 
as the Trans Islands Highway linking the two provinces. The road provides for our 
local market produce to be transported to Open Bay Station to be sold at the 
market. It also provides for transport to gardening as we do most of our gardening 
activities on OBT’s harvesting areas. 
Until about last year some of our people manage to reach as far as Kokopo 
following the constructed Trans Islands High Way that runs through the 
Matanakunai Ward to West New Britain. This year people started flocking into 
Kerevat and back for just a day or two depending on the PMV schedules. The only 
problem that is causing hindrance is the Toriu river causing difficulty to cross over 
due to no construction of permanent bridge. 
In the past we have a limit using only OBT logging access roads to Wide Bay and 
Baia in West New Britain. The road is unsealed and is being gravelled with 
sedimentary rocks from major rivers within OBT plantation area, most of which are 
lose and is meant for logging purposes only. Due to the looseness of the gravel it 
is very risky since cars and trucks can easily slip off the road in the course of high 
speed so speed limits are being stressed every time.</p>

<td>
	<p>In here the main source of water supply is running water from the nearby creeks. 
In villages like Aubu-alaba, Vao and Vunapeo, they use both creeks and wells but 
usually gets dried up during dry season. It becomes very difficult when it comes to 
dry season in terms of water supply for these villages and so they have to walk 
distances to get avail of a water source. 
Water tanks are only for those who can afford the cost including freight from Town 
to the village. Most people use drums and malfunctioned deep fridge to catch rain 
water for bathing, laundary, cooking and drinking. Others use main stream 
channels like Matalailai, Valeleoa and Malani Rivers. </p>

	<p>Primitive method of disposing human waste is the most popular one here, second 
to that is pit toilets. For pit toilets, people do use that but it gives off very bad 
smell that is why it is always unattended to. Sometimes it is being built but not 
used and in other areas of the ward it gets waterlogged and the waste floats to 
the top especially during wet season.  
There are no proper waste disposal procedures especially on sanitation given to 
the people and so people ignore the proper methods of disposing human waste.</p>

<td>
<p>The most common type of transport used here are the Land and Sea which also 
applies to our forefathers. That is by canoe and by walking long distances, lately 
the introduction of vehicles by OBT to cater for its operational needs also 
provided for transport services to the people. It also gave light to the usage of 
vehicles as a mean of transport. 
Common type of transport used for distant locations is sea and especially by 
outboard motor. With the development of roads (New Britain Highway), vehicles 
became a mean of transport by land to distant locations such as Kokopo and 
Kimbe. Air transport was available in the past from 80’s-90’s 
and unfortunately closed down leaving us with only Land and Sea mediums of 
transport. </p>

<p>Due to lack of infrastructure, the ward has yet to secure a funding to help build a 
permanent community hall. Several attempts had been made to the LLG level but 
was not successful. Most of the meetings are held in an open air setup at selected venues.</p>
