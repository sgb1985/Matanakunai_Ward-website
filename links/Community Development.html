<h3>Law and Order</h3>
<h4>Village Court</h4>
<p>The ward has an established village court system and also mandated village court officials 
approved by the department of Justice and Attorney General. It oversees law and order 
problems in both Matanakunai and Open Bay Wards. Officials are selected from within the 
two wards. There is a village court facility (Court House) but is no longer usable due to its 
bad condition needing intensive renovation. All court hearings are done at the Open Bay rural 
police station. </p>
	<h4>Ward Law and Order Committee</h4>
	<p> A law and order committee was formed in 2017 and is still current but we have some of the 
committees moved out to other provinces and places. This law and order committee 
comprises of police personnel and appointed committees from Open Bay and Matanakunai 
wards. A meeting has already been sat for to restructure the Ward Law & Order Committees.</p>
