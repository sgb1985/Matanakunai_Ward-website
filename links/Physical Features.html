       <p>Matanakunai Ward is located roughly about 27km from the East - West Provincial 
border and about 2km from Open Bay Ward and Open Bay Station. The 
landscape is relatively flat with vegetation dominated by secondary/Lowland Rain 
Forest. The soil type is mainly Clay, Silt and Loam but the texture is mainly Clay 
with limestone karst on hilly terrain further inland from the coast. The area 
experiences high rainfall in a year especially at the beginning of the year and 
also at the end of the year. Since it is flat, the area tends to be water logged for a 
month then it gets dried. Along the coast the forest is Casuarina, Mangrove and 
Swamp. </p>

	<h3>History</h3>
<p>According to verbal history, prior to the colonial era and also the landing of Catholic 
Missionaries in this area, about ¾ of the total population migrated from West New 
Britain through the process of exercising Barter System, and only one clan is believed to 
have previously inhabited the area who migrated from inland to the coast. These inland 
and coastal people were primarily producers and consumers who were heavily involved 
in Barter System and later on were bonded together by this relationship and also 
through intermarriages. During those days there were no settlement sites on the coast 
and so they came up with an agreement to settle together as one people in our current 
historical village site known of as Kaboku. This is where the Tribe name of the Kaboku 
people was derived from.  </p>

<p>After a lot of tribal war fares with the neighbouring Makolkol and Kol tribes and other 
coastal warriors from different tribes along the coast of West New Britain, they moved 
on to another place near the Toriu River Mouth called Muine Bibi-lua for security 
reasons and lived there for many years [no accounts on the number of years]. In this place they 
started experiencing population explosion and so some of the families decided to move 
on and invaded an island called Ailo just about 2km from the current open Bay Main 
Market and Shopping Centre. At this island, colonial era began, it took some good 
donkey years living on the island. Catholic Missionaries also reached over around this 
time and erected a cross on the shore at what is now the current OBT Main Market. 
After some years Vunapope Catholic Mission bought and secured a piece of land 
around the Toriu River to the Kaboku people which was later converted to a coconut 
plantation and is currently known of as Toriu Plantation.  </p>

<p>From there on, there was peace and harmony in the Kaboku society, but sadly they 
were issued an alarm by a catholic priest advising them to vacate the island and 
explaining to them that there is war and it has already reached PNG, particularly 
Rabaul. After the priest left, the island was bombed by a war plane resulting in a 
number of injuries and deaths. The eastern tip of the island was destroyed and sank 
forcing people to move out and refuge in care centres made available by American 
Allies at Moramora in West New Britain. </p>
<p>After the war went on to ceasefire, the Kaboku people came back and settled in Tagio 
village (current OBT Log pond area). It was in 1973-1974 when Open Bay Timber 
began its first operational phase and so the village was relocated to Matanakunai to 
prepare that area for a log storage and loading port. A year later PNG gained 
independence which got our forefathers to see the Australian Flag Lowered and PNG 
Flag Raised and waved to the rhythm of the cool mountain breeze of our land, 
celebrated at Open Bay with Japanese & Filipino Expats on the 16th of September 1975. 
From there on the Kaboku people permanently reside in Matanakunai Village. </p>

   <h3>Culture</h3>
<p>We are of the Meramera ethnicity, a minor proportion of the whole Nakanai Tradition 
inhabiting the north coast of West New Britain and part of East New Britain of which we 
are now situated. The Kaboku society is maternal by heritage and is headed by a chief 
which was later replaced by luluais and tultuls during colonial era. The society also 
practises polygamy especially for individuals who possess valuable items of traditional 
wealth, i.e pigs, shell money, etc, this also applies to warriors. </p>
<p>Men are regarded as principal decision makers so all administration affairs of the 
society are handled by the chief and the elders. Ladies are not eligible to participate in 
decision making, they are to take care of household duties and make love, but there are 
some cases when they are being given opportunity to perform certain rituals and 
dances by which men are not allowed to. This is especially when it comes to major 
ceremonies such as bride price and a first born child being initiated to become part of 
the society. During this ceremonies men are not allowed to take revenge if they are 
being injured or held on to by ladies. </p>
<p>Marriage is not selective as we do nowadays, but is being arranged by the elders. 
Individuals who are being chosen will not know each other so all young men and 
women are not allowed to live together or see each other’s face, only when you are 
being called for wedding and bride price ceremony. But all that has been influenced by 
western culture. The shell money and other valuable items used in bride price ceremony 
are, a shell known of as Tuali in Meramera, pigs,bubu (a necklace type) baskets of taro 
and sago plus other garden stuff. All these items will be placed on and under a table like 
structure of about 4-5m high. Taro baskets and sagos are placed on the platform built 
on that structure with sugar canes, pigs will be placed under the structure, other garden 
stuff like bananas with betel nuts will be hanged on a special tree, cut, trimmed and 
erected in front of the structure and is about 8-12m high. The bride is being dressed 
with necklaces and marital paintings, the groom will be dressed with paintings and shell 
money plus other items of wealth and get his items exchanged for his bride to the 
relatives of the partner. This also applies to the First born child initiation ceremony, but 
the difference is that there won’t be any payments done. </p>
<p>The major dances of the meramera culture is Rai, Balenpis and kela, all come with the 
same beat and are mainly danced to by the beat of kundu drums and harmonized by a 
song sung in the meramera language. Items used for dressing are special feathers from 
different varieties of birds and cassowary hairs/feathers used to hold by the fingers and 
dance. </p>
