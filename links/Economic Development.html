<p>Agriculture has been the most effective form of earning a living in the early days till current. 
Subsistence farming is the most commonly used form of agriculture. The agriculture 
products are being sold for money while others are reserved for consumption. There has 
been a number of logging and agriculture projects but the impact on the local economy is 
minimal, most of them went failed. A ward meeting late last year resolved to accept for an 
application of an AGRICULTURE TA to convert a 50 hectares of land into an agriculture 
area. The benefits generated from this project will help to support the community on its 
financial needs in terms of infrastructure projects and individual benefits.</p>

	<p>Most of the land in and around the ward is customarily owned by the Kaboku people who 
dominated the majority of the wardâ€™s population. There are specific portions of land being 
alienated which is owned by the state. Others have not been properly acquired and still yet 
to be confirmed. With the current increased number of logging operations around these 
areas, the land owners through a local landowner company had signed an agreement with a 
developer to lease a portion of land for economic benefits. These benefits were used to 
secure land issues. A ward meeting late last year also resolved to support the respective 
ILGs to apply for registrations over this area to secure from land grabs.</p>

	<p>There are other potential resources that can be utilised to generate opportunities that 
will support the community (people) but will need more resources and effort. 
Transportation and Market avenues are still an existing problem that are being faced 
with. That is why, most of our cash crops such as cocoa and coconuts are left 
unattended to, not even processed for marketing. The following needs resources and 
training; 

<ul>
<li>Livestock</li>
<li>Fishery</li>
<li>Tourism</li>
<li>Other Cash crops</li>
</ul>
